# This is the default environment activated by a 
# `quarto render` or `quarto preview` command.
# Thus, any .qmd file containing a reference to 
# {{< env MAPBOX_CYCLING_TOKEN >}}
# will use the token below, which is public but restricted 
# in scope. In particular, this environment generates code 
# that works only when deployed to https://marksmath.org/.
# 
# For development, you'll want to use your Mapbox default 
# public token, which is unrestricted in scope so it will 
# work from Quarto's development scope. We can place that 
# in a file of the form  _environment-devel and then preview
# or render with 
# quarto preview --profile devel
#
# Of course, that second file should be added to 
# .gitignore so that it's not published on GitHub!
#
# You'll need your own key, if you want this to work on your 
# webspace; here's mine, which works only on marksmath.org:
