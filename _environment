# This is the default environment activated by a 
# `quarto render` or `quarto preview` command.
# Thus, any .qmd file containing a reference to 
# {{< env MAPBOX_CYCLING_TOKEN >}}
# will use the token below, which is restricted in scope.
# 
# For development, we want to use Mapbox's Default public token,
# which is unrestricted in scope and will work from Quarto's
# development scope. We can place that in a file of the form 
# _environment-devel and then preview or render with 
# quarto preview --profile devel
#
# Of course, that second file should be added to 
# .gitignore so that it's not published on GitHub!
