According to [UNCA's Class Schedules](https://www.unca.edu/schedules/), I've taught 36 different courses spread over 161 distinct course sections to 2861 students since the Fall of 2006. Each circle below corresponds to one of those courses; the area of each circle is proportional to the number of times I've taught that course and you can hover over the circles to get a bit more information.

```{ojs}
import {make_force_animation} from './components/make_force_animation.js';
courses = await FileAttachment("./components/courses.csv")
    .csv({typed: true});
make_force_animation(courses)
```
