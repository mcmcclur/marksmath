Sample datasets

- College Football 2024
  - Description: Lists team stats for all 135 D1 College Football teams for the Fall 2024 season. I assembled this summary data from more detailed data obtained from [Massey Ratings](https://masseyratings.com/).
  - [CSV](./CFBStats/CFB2024.csv)
- Colors
  - Description: This is a small, manufactured data set of RGB values that are *close* to primary colors; there are also a few missing values values. The intention is to illustrate imputation with, for example, a KNN imputer.
  - [CSV](./colors.csv)
- NCAA Basketball data (multiple files for sports analytics)
  - The Big South 2025 Regular Season 
    - Description: Game by game results of the Mens's 2025 Big South regular season.
    - [CSV](BigSouth2025RegularSeason.csv)
  - Big South Games with Eigen ratings 
    - Big South games with score differences and Eigen ratings for the 2023/24 Season 
    - [CSV](big_south_games_with_ratings.csv)
  - Big South Games with Massey ratings 
    - Big South games with score differences and Massey ratings for the 2023/24 Season 
    - [CSV](big_south_games_with_massey_ratings.csv)
  - Paired Tournament Games
    - Lists all Men's NCAA Tournament games from 2010 through 2023. Each game lists the difference of the Massey ratings between Team 1 and Team 2, as well as the seed difference between the teams. There's also a Boolean label indicating whether Team 1 defeated Team 2. The intention is illustrate a machine learning approach to sports prediction and each game appears twice to maximize the data set.

  - Processed Kaggle data.
    - There are four files here - two for the men's tournament and two for women. *Prior* tournament games record actual past tournament games dating back to 2010 up through the 2024 tournament. Each game has a slew of team stats and a label indicating who won the game. *Potential* tournament games lists all possible pairs of tournament games from the 2025 tournament with the data but no labels. The idea was to generate a Kaggle submission file [the 2025 submission](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/march-machine-learning-mania-2025/overview).
    - [Men's priors](Mprior_tourney_games2025.csv)
    - [Men's potentials](Mpotential_tourney_games2025.csv)

    - [Women's potentials](Wpotential_tourney_games2025.csv)
- Palmer Penguins
  - [Reference](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/)
  - [CSV](./penguins.csv)

- Wine
  - Description: This is a modified version of the data obtained from SciKit Learn's `sklearn.datasets.load_wine` function. I simply renamed the "target" variable to "variety" and placed it all in one CSV file to obtain a nice classification example.
