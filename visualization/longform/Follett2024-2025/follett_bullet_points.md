Follett Access is a fee based program for textbook and courseware distribution run by Follett - the company that has run UNCA's campus bookstore since the fall of 2011. The key feature that distinguishes Follett Access from the current mode, where students purchase their textbooks individually, is that the books are paid for via a fee that is collected along with their tuition. All students would be automatically enrolled in Follett Access under the plan and pay for every credit hour or pay a flat rate per semester, depending on plan specifics.

### Benefits according to Follett

- Savings of 20-60% as compared to "equivalent pricing",
- Promotes academic freedom, by making all materials available,
- Improved student learning outcomes, due to simple day one readiness.

These statements are on many of Follett's webpages, such as

### However

- My data indicates that UNCA students would spend *more* money on Follett provided materials under Follett Access than they would under the current plan.

Student payments to Follett could very well *increase* over 70%.

- Any single vendor necessarily restricts choice and, therefore, academic freedom. Worse,

Follett Access undermines the academic work of faculty and staff aimed at providing *free* materials.
:::

- While Follett points to the work of one researcher on student outcomes in particular, there's certainly evidence indicating no statistical impact of inclusive access programs on student learning.

::: {.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
\large
Data on student learning outcomes are *mixed at best*.
:::


Perhaps, all this is why less than one third of all UNCA course sections use Follett Supplied materials.
